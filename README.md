# Visualization Portfolio
This repository contains the data visualizations that I developed in the class Telling Stories with Data (94870-B2) taught by Chris Goranson in the Fall/2019.

## About me
My name is Jessica Colnago ([she/her](https://www.mypronouns.org/she-her)) and I'm a PhD student in Societal Computing (Computer Science). My main research interest is in the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction and Privacy, in particular focusing on a phenomenon that I refer to as "privacy resignation."

The life-plan after the PhD is to work in industry research, helping companies develop usable and privacy conscious products.

## What I hope to learn
Since I hope to go into industry I hope to learn how to communicate data and the story I want to tell with that data more effectively. I feel that during the PhD we learn how to do it efficiently, but the visualizations and data representations tend to not be very interesting or captivating. Hopefully taking this class will make the transition into industry communication easier once I get there.
